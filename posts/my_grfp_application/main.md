# The NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP)
The [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program) is a prestigious fellowship awarded to applicants who have demonstrated potential to make significant contributions to their research fields. Normally, over 2,000 applicants are selected for this award each year. However, the 2025 cycle granted only 1,000 initial awards, followed by 500 additional awards announced a few months later. 

Given the competitiveness of recent application rounds, I wanted to share my application materials. I was fortunate to be selected for this prestigious award, and I hope these materials will help you prepare for the upcoming mid-November deadlines. I've also included my reviewer feedback so you can get a sense of what the evaluations look like.

# My Writing Strategy
I focused on three main strategies that I believe helped me secure this fellowship:

1. Emphasizing my work's **potential toward "national science"**
2. **Telling a cohesive story**
3. **Seeking consistent feedback**

### 1. Potential Toward National Science
One key element emphasized in the [current solicitation](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program/nsf25-547/solicitation) is the benefit your research provides to national interests. This includes *"[improving] national security,"* *"[increasing] the economic competitiveness of the U.S.,"* and *"[developing] a globally competitive STEM workforce."*  

Much of my research was conducted with the Air Force Research Laboratory, where I directly supported Air Force and Space Force needs. In fact, the *Intellectual Merit* section of my personal statement was structured around the Air Force's Core Values. Presenting my research through this lens helped reviewers see my experience contributing to the nation's scientific posture.  

You can best emphasize this perspective in the *Broader Impacts* sections of your application. When writing, try to think from a "national science" point of view; how your work can serve or strengthen the nation's scientific and societal goals.

### 2. Explain a Good Story
A good story flows naturally. This is especially important since reviewers often look at around 25 applications and may only spend a few minutes on each. If you can clearly **guide** reviewers to your potential and your fit for the fellowship, you'll significantly improve your chances.  

In my *Intellectual Merit* section, I framed my academic development using the Air Force's Core Values: *"Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do."* This structure allowed me to connect my academic development from freshman year to senior year in a meaningful way.  

For my research plan, I used a "two-point" approach focused on developing fault-tolerant and efficient vision models for onboard satellite deployment. By connecting ideas step by step, I was able to build a coherent narrative around the problem and how I planned to solve it.

### 3. Consistent Feedback
Consistency is key! We've all heard it before, but it's especially important for an opportunity this big and competitive. I went through about eight rounds of review with different people like my mentors, friends, AFROTC cadre, and PhD students.

A great way to simulate the review process is to hand your materials to a busy PhD student in your field. Like GRFP reviewers, they'll skim quickly and point out what's unclear or unconvincing straight off the bat. (Thanks, Amandeep!)
